[PATh](https://path-cc.io/) brings together the Center for High Throughput Computing and the OSG in order to advance the nationâ€™s campuses and science communities through the use of distributed High Throughput Computing.

Thie website is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based website.  The theme is based on [Jekyll-Serif](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/jekyll-serif-theme).  Please create a pull request to modify the website.

# Deployment

To have you changes merged into the main website you must create a PR and get one review before you are allowed to merge. If you don't have anyone in mind you can request _@CannonLock_ and he will review it the next morning.

# Development

The following three guides contain a method to view your website changes before creating a PR.

### Installing Ruby & Jekyll
 
If this is your first time using Jekyll, please follow the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and make sure your local environment (including Ruby) is setup correctly.

### Using Github for Development

1. Create a Branch from master with 'preview-' at the start of the branch name
  - For instance 'preview-helloworld'
2. Push this branch to the repo at https://github.com/path-cc/path-cc.github.io.git
  - If you created the branch on github it is already there!
4. Populate the changes that you want to see
5. Preview the changes that you have made at https://path-cc.io/web-preview/<branch-name\>/ 
  - For this instance https://path-cc.io/web-preview/preview-helloworld/
6. When you are happy with the changes create a PR into master

### Using Docker for Development

Depending on your environment, it may be more useful to run Jekyll inside a container.  To do this, run the following from your laptop while inside the checked-out copy of the website source:

```
docker run -it -p 8003:8000 -v $PWD:/app -w /app ruby:2.7 /bin/bash
```

This will utilize the latest Jekyll version and map port `8000` to your host.  Within the container, a small HTTP server can be started with the following command:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --config _config.yml -H 0.0.0.0 -P 8000
```

This will build and serve the website; it can be viewed by navigating your web browser to <http://localhost:8000>.

With the `--watch` flag set, any changes you make to the website source will cause a new version of the website to be built; it usually takes 4-5 seconds between hitting "Save" and then "Refresh" on the website.

# Pushing Changes to Production

The production website (https://path-cc.io/) is built automatically by GitHub Pages from the **master** branch.

To make changes to the website, use the following workflow:

1.  Submit a pull request with website updates to the `master` branch (the default) and request a review.
    - Any reviews with visual changes can be handled more quickly if you provide a [preview instance](#using-github-for-development)
1.  Upon approval and merge you can view the changes at https://path-cc.io
